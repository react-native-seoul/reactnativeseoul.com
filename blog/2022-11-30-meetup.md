At this meetup, presentations were made in groups determined at the previous meetup. We would like to thank the presenters again for their hard work.

The first announcement was made by Hyungu Kang, a developer at Sandbird. We learned in detail about FlatList, which is often used in React Native, and how to optimize it. The presentation video is attached at the link below.

Unfortunately, I couldn't share the rest of the presentation because the video was cut off, but I would also like to thank Lee Tae-heon for sharing how to use Naver Map.

As promised, a prize of 500,000 won will be given to the team that proceeded with the presentation. Prizes will be awarded at the next meetup on January 25th :)

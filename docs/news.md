From January 25, 2023, the name of the meetup will be changed from React Native Seoul to Cross Platform Korea.
Since React Native is a cross-platform technology after all, and Flutter and MAUI can also develop services while responding to multiple platforms in a similar way, we saw that there are many opportunities to broaden our knowledge and communicate.

I hope that future meetups will be more beneficial and interesting to all of you.

## [meetup]

The next meetup is scheduled for Wednesday, January 25th from 7:30pm to 9:30pm. The meetup application will be held in early January.

Happy New Year and see you on the event day üòÅ

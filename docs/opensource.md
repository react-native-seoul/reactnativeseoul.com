The community discovers and shares opensources necessary for business.
Since they are difficult to operate due to insufficient time and support, help, and support are appreciated.
We hope to improve developer culture through the opensource with more people in the community.

## Corporate Collaboration

If there is a company that has the necessary opensource ideas in-house, it would be nice if it could be developed with a reasonable budget. The community uses [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/dooboolab-community) to manage all budgets transparently.

If there are some interested companies, please contact [dooboolab support](mailto:support@dooboolab.com).
